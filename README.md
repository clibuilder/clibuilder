A highly customizable command line application builder.

## What's new in v8

Key highlights:

- Support standalone CLI
  - `name` and `version` are now required and not read from `package.json`.
- Plugins are loaded through config
  - This drastically improve startup time, as it does not scan `node_modules` anymore.
  - Also better support other package manager such as `yarn PnP` and `pnpm`.
- `keywords` are now used for plugin lookup.
- Distribute `ESM` along with `CJS`.

## Feature Highlights

- support default commands and sub-commands `my-cli cmd1 cmd2 cmd3`
- configuration file support
- plugin support: write commands in separate packages and reuse by multiple CLI
- type inference and validation for config, arguments, and options\
  using [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) (exported as `z`)
